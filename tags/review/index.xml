      <title>The Great Mental Models - 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are around 9 mental models mentioned in the The Great Mental Models book. I&amp;rsquo;m going to
describe last but not the least resonating mental model of them, which is know
as &lt;code&gt;Occam&#39;s Razor&lt;/code&gt;. [&lt;a href=&#34;https://fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/&#34;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor is a principle, which state that - &lt;code&gt;Suppose there exist two
explanations for an occurrence. In this case the one that requires the least
speculation is usually correct. Another way of saying it is that the more
assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation.&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In layman&amp;rsquo;s word, it simply means - If there is a simple way to prove
a hypothesis, then there is no need to bring in superfluous/complex elements
into the discussion, which can lead to difficulty to test and prove the
hypothesis itself. The simplest explanations are more likely to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said that, simplicity doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean brevity. Explaining brief of the problem, or
approaching part of a solution is not what we want. Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor principle is
used to eliminate anything surplus, which is unnecessary in explaining or
proving the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example from Wikipedia page.&lt;/br&gt;
Two trees have fallen down during a windy night. Think about these two possible
explanations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wind has blown them down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two meteorites have each taken one tree down and, after striking the trees, hit each other removing any trace of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote by Einstein to sum it up: &lt;code&gt;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Great Mental Models - 2</title>
      <link>https://snbk97.github.io/posts/tgmm-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the previous [&lt;a href=&#34;../tgmm-1&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;], I want to talk about the next
mental model that is know as &lt;code&gt;Second-order thinking&lt;/code&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/&#34;&gt;Read
More&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mental model enables us to evaluate our decision that we take to solve our
problems for the time being and not worry about it&amp;rsquo;s consequence in the
long run. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, easy and instant. No need to scratch you head to think
about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, Second Order thinking need a little time to think and consider
the consequence which you might face in the long term because of this one
decision you make. Sometime it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to think to the second order, we
can choose to think even one step further to the Third Order of thinking.
The decisions we make must have an answer to &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; we are taking this decision
in every step of the way. Is it valuable in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A excellent example given in the book was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more traction to car tires, makes it easier to control on the roads and
slides less. (This is an example of first order thinking)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the second order thinking comes into play if we think about the effects
it&amp;rsquo;s going to have on the environment and the car parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to more traction, the engine now has to work harder, resulting in less
 mileage of the vehicle. Also this cause more emission in the
environment and more rubber particles left out in the ground. (Second order
thinking)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The Great Mental Models - 1</title>
      <link>https://snbk97.github.io/posts/tgmm-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my review of the book &amp;ldquo;The Great Mental Model&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://fs.blog&#34;&gt;Shane
Parrish&lt;/a&gt;. In
this review, I will talk about the things that rather resonated with my
thinking. The main focus of mental models is to look at problems in a more
holistic way and then approach their solution. This was covered in the &lt;code&gt;Thought
Experiment&lt;/code&gt; chapter of this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;center&#34;  src=&#34;https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41phGRru5OL._SX260_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Great Mental Model&#34; title=&#34;The Great Mental Model&#34;&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must be wondering what mental models actually are. Okay, so let me tell you
what I understood from it. Mental models are a way of seeing the world from
many different angles and comprehend how the world works.
So when you are thinking of solutions, think in every angle possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;It is advised to learn multiple mental model and apply them in your life, so that
you don&#39;t have to distort reality to fit your mental models.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think about solving a problem, we most often think about the solution
in the same domain in which the problem lies. This is where we must try to
understand the gravity of the problem in multiple disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a researcher, you think in term of success rates of experiments and
reports. Similarly, if you&amp;rsquo;re a business man, you think in term of profit or
loss of your company&amp;rsquo;s revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the process of thinking is embedded into out brain via the
education system and work environments. This not a bad way of thinking, it does
comes handy to prevent common mistakes. But, it does &lt;strong&gt;narrow&lt;/strong&gt; our vision towards
the issue and how we perceive the world and problems associated in within it.&lt;/p&gt;
