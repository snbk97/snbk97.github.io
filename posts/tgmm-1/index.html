    <p>This is my review of the book &ldquo;The Great Mental Model&rdquo; by <a href="https://fs.blog">Shane
Parrish</a>. In
this review, I will talk about the things that rather resonated with my
thinking. The main focus of mental models is to look at problems in a more
holistic way and then approach their solution. This was covered in the <code>Thought
Experiment</code> chapter of this book.</p>

<p>You must be wondering what mental models actually are. Okay, so let me tell you
what I understood from it. Mental models are a way of seeing the world from
many different angles and comprehend how the world works.
So when you are thinking of solutions, think in every angle possible.</p>

<p><code>It is advised to learn multiple mental model and apply them in your life, so that
you don't have to distort reality to fit your mental models.</code></p>

<p>When we think about solving a problem, we most often think about the solution
in the same domain in which the problem lies. This is where we must try to
understand the gravity of the problem in multiple disciplines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are a researcher, you think in term of success rates of experiments and
reports. Similarly, if you&rsquo;re a business man, you think in term of profit or
loss of your company&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how the process of thinking is embedded into out brain via the
education system and work environments. This not a bad way of thinking, it does
comes handy to prevent common mistakes. But, it does <strong>narrow</strong> our vision towards
the issue and how we perceive the world and problems associated in within it.</p>
