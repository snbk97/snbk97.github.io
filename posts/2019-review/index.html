Well, It was a pretty good year for me as well. It was one of the year which had overwhelmed me with what it had to offer in both ways - positive and negative.
I learnt some very ancient but also few interesting tech in college like 6Bone, MobileIP, Computer graphics, Turing machines (almost flunked), last but not least, exciting tech : Java servlet 2."/>

    <p><code>2019</code> - The year of Keanu Reves memes, Tesla's cyber truck, Greta Thunberg's concern for the environment, ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 success et cetera</p>
<p>Well, It was a pretty good year for me as well. It was one of the year which had overwhelmed me with what it had to offer in both ways - positive and negative.</p>
<p>I learnt some very ancient but also few interesting tech in college like 6Bone, MobileIP, Computer graphics, Turing machines (almost flunked), last but not least, exciting tech : Java servlet 2.0 (/s)</p>
<p>Also I completed my 4th and 5th semesters in college, which is pretty great news.</p>
<p>Some how managed to get a software engineering internship and hope to  get the full-time position also. The preparation for which somewhat a mixture of hard work and LOT OF LUCK. To be honest, it was fucking annoying at best, to go through at least 3-4 interviews (till the last round), just to hear the same sh*t &ldquo;Better Luck Next Time. Kek&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JK, it was more like - Good luck for your next interviews, f*ck off now m8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New habit, that I'm looking into - listening to podcasts and talk shows. People really talk about really fascinating things about life, thoughts, food, religion and most importantly TECH.</p>
<p><strong>To name a few -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Podcast</strong> - Lex Fridman</li>
<li><strong>If then else</strong> - Mayuko</li>
<li><strong>Habit Coach</strong> - Ashdin Doctor</li>
<li><strong>The Vinamre Kasanaa show</strong> - Vinamre Kasana</li>
<li><strong>PG Radio</strong> - Prakhar Gupta</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming to the end of this post, I'm left with 6 more months of college, which will be spent mostly in the internship and hopefully other productive things.
Let's see what 2020 brings us.</p>
<p>Happy New Year !</p>
