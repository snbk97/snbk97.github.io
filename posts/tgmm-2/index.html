    <p>Continuing with the previous [<a href="../tgmm-1">post</a>], I want to talk about the next
mental model that is know as <code>Second-order thinking</code>[<a href="https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/">Read
More</a>]</p>
<p>This mental model enables us to evaluate our decision that we take to solve our
problems for the time being and not worry about it's consequence in the
long run. It's fast, easy and instant. No need to scratch you head to think
about the future.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Second Order thinking need a little time to think and consider
the consequence which you might face in the long term because of this one
decision you make. Sometime it's not enough to think to the second order, we
can choose to think even one step further to the Third Order of thinking.
The decisions we make must have an answer to &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; we are taking this decision
in every step of the way. Is it valuable in the long run.</p>
<p>A excellent example given in the book was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding more traction to car tires, makes it easier to control on the roads and
slides less. (This is an example of first order thinking)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the second order thinking comes into play if we think about the effects
it's going to have on the environment and the car parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to more traction, the engine now has to work harder, resulting in less
mileage of the vehicle. Also this cause more emission in the
environment and more rubber particles left out in the ground. (Second order
thinking)</p>
</blockquote>
