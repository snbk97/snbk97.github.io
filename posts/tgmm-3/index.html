    <p>There are around 9 mental models mentioned in the The Great Mental Models book. I&rsquo;m going to
describe last but not the least resonating mental model of them, which is know
as <code>Occam's Razor</code>. [<a href="https://fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/">Read more</a>]</p>

<p>Occam&rsquo;s Razor is a principle, which state that - <code>Suppose there exist two
explanations for an occurrence. In this case the one that requires the least
speculation is usually correct. Another way of saying it is that the more
assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation.</code> &ndash; <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>In layman&rsquo;s word, it simply means - If there is a simple way to prove
a hypothesis, then there is no need to bring in superfluous/complex elements
into the discussion, which can lead to difficulty to test and prove the
hypothesis itself. The simplest explanations are more likely to be correct.</p>

<p>Said that, simplicity doesn&rsquo;t mean brevity. Explaining brief of the problem, or
approaching part of a solution is not what we want. Occam&rsquo;s Razor principle is
used to eliminate anything surplus, which is unnecessary in explaining or
proving the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example from Wikipedia page.</br>
Two trees have fallen down during a windy night. Think about these two possible
explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wind has blown them down.</li>
<li>Two meteorites have each taken one tree down and, after striking the trees, hit each other removing any trace of themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote by Einstein to sum it up: <code>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</code></p>
